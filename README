We are aiming to provide c++ & python code for standard textbook data structures and algorithms.

Currently, the following algorithms are working:

* Kruskals
* Matrix Chain Multiplication - Optimization

There are some other algorithms that can be used:

* The Josephus Problem
* Breadth First Search
* Depth First Search

In terms of data structures, the following are available:

* An adjacency matrix representation of a graph (in C++)
* An adjacency list representation of a graph (C++)
* A class that provides all the comparison operators based on the presence of a cmp function 
  or a less than operator in a class (see: default_operators.hpp)
